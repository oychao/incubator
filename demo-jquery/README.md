## TBD

1. ```$.fn.one(event, selector, callback)``` Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element per event type.
2. ```$.fn.off()``` Remove an event handler.
3. ```$.fn.position()``` Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent.
4. ```$.fn.prop()``` Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more properties for every matched element.
